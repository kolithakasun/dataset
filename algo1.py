#Python program to add three numbers
#with the help of above designed algorithm


#Take the 3 number as inputs
num1 = int(input("Enter the 1st number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the 2nd number: "))
num3 = int(input("Enter the 3rd number: "))

#Calculate the sum using + operator and store it in variable sum
sum = num1 + num2 + num3

#Print the sum
print("\nSum of the 3 number is: ", sum)
